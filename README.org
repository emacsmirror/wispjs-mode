* Wisp Mode

A major mode for the Lisp->JavaScript language [[http://jeditoolkit.com/wisp/][Wisp]].

** Installation

=M-x package-install wisp-mode=

...if you're hooked up to [[http://marmalade-repo.org/][Marmalade]] or [[http://melpa.milkbox.net/][MELPA]].
If not, add this to your =.emacs= first:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("marmalade" . "http://marmalade-repo.org/packages/"))
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa" . "http://melpa.milkbox.net/packages/"))
(package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

/(You only need one of the =package-archives= lines, Marmalade or MELPA, but there's no harm in having both.)/

/Alternatively/, just grab the single =wisp-mode.el= and install that in your preferred way.

** Status

Ready to use, but fairly basic. Feedback welcomed.
